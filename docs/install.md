# auto_SAR_Ocean_Contrast \(autonomous Ocean Contrast Estimation for SAR Images\)

# Installation

## 1. Requirements
The GeoTIFF interface requires *libgdal 3.8.4* or later.  There are many ways 
to install this on your system, e.g., macports (*port install gdal*).  This should happen automatically when following the instructions below.

## 2. Installation 

./install [NewCondaEnvironmentName] [PythonVersion] 

If NewCondaEnvironmentName is specified, a new Conda environment is created and installation occurs there.  Otherwise, installation instructions for installing in the base environment are printed out.  
  
The code works with python 3.8 and possibly later versions depending upon the processor on your computer.  Note: The code was tested on an M1 Mac and worked with python 3.9.
