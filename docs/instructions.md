# auto_SAR_Ocean_Contrast \(autonomous Ocean Contrast Estimation for SAR Images\)
# Instructions
**NOTE:** The contrast ratio is calculated from the NRCS in linear units, not in dB.

## 1. Input files
The code requires a calibrated SAR image file and an incidence angle file or layer on the same grid as the image.  The input can be in one of the three following formats:

**Geotiff**

Band 1 - Calibrated SAR image (in linear units or dB)  
Band 2 - Incidence angle \(in degrees or radians\)  
Optional Band 3 - Latitude \(not used by this code\)  
Optional Band 4 - Longitude \(not used by this code\)  

**NetCDF**  
The code also works with a NetCDF file in the [NOAA CoastWatch](https://coastwatch.noaa.gov/cwn/data-access-tools/coastwatch-data-portal.html) file format.  This file contains the calibrated image with land masked out and an incidence angle layer.

*Information on the NOAA CoastWatch file format is [here](https://www.star.nesdis.noaa.gov/socd/coastwatch/cwf/cw_cf_metadata.pdf).  We make no commitment that this description is up-to-date so check the [sample input data files](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.12702460) to see the contents.*

**ENVI Binary Raster**  
This option is intended to work with [UAVSAR](https://uavsar.jpl.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/data.pl) PolSAR standard products, using the standard product incidence angle .inc file provided for the PolSAR products.  These are flat binary files in real*4 format (32-bit floating point) with the NRCS in linear units. ENVI .hdr files are required to specify the dimensions of the grid and the georeferencing, if provided.  The code works for UAVSAR data in radar coordinates or geographical coordinates.

The code is written to process multiple polarizations for a UAVSAR product basename.  The code requires that the search for clean water pixels be done on a file with NRCS in dB, whereas the standard UAVSAR products are in linear units.  The user must create this file.  In the sample data, the example file given is the total NRCS in dB. 

**Optional Land Mask**  
In the mask, values 0=water and 1=land.  The land mask is a flat binary file in real*4 format (32-bit floating point). An ENVI .hdr file is required to specify the dimensions of the grid.  There must be a 1:1 correspondence between the land mask grid and the NRCS file grid.  

**Sample input and output files for each input format option are available at

## 2. Instructions for running the code

The Jupyer Notebook **auto_calc_contrast_in_ocean.ipynb** contains the code for the algorithm.  In the first code block the user sets the working directory \(parameter *wd*\) and whether to display additional plots at intermediate steps in the processing \(*debug = True*\).  If processing of multiple files is requested, the JNB code stops after processing a single file and the user must manually adjust the index to process each subsequent file.  The python code **auto_calc_contrast_in_ocean.py** is a stand-alone version that is easier to use when processing multiple files.

A **config.yaml** file is used to describe input data and select processing options. The directory **prototypes** contains example config.yaml files for each input data format, which can be edited and renamed to config.yaml for running the code.  The config.yaml file needs to be in the working directory (top level).  

**The config.yaml file specifies the following:**  
 - input and output file formats  
 - input file names \(wildcards and subdirectories accepted\)  
 - output directory  
 - whether the input NRCS is in dB or linear units (GeoTIFF only)  
 - whether the incidence angle is in degrees or radians
 - polarization mode \(e.g., VV, HH, HV, VH\) (GeoTIFF only)
 - whether to set either upper or lower incidence angle limits and their values  
 - The incidence angle bin size \(*incangbinsize*\) is used to account for the NRCS dependence on incidence angle and usually can be set to 1-2 degrees.  The exception is if the total angular range is small (~<3 degrees) in which case smaller bin size must be used to have sufficient points for the fit.
 - a flag to specify whether an enternal land mask is to be applied and the landmask file name
 - The *bootstrap* option is for hard-to-ID areas and uses the previous bin's clean water NRCS to search for the current clean water peak.  

FOR NETCDF: The config.yaml file for NetCDF input also contains a list of the variables in the input file that must be kept in the output file to match the NOAA CoastWatch format.

FOR ENVI: 
 - infiles is used to identify the likely clean water pixels and the base filenames for UAVSAR products. The NRCS values in the infiles are expected to be in dB. NOTE: the user must generate these from the standard UAVSAR products, which are in linear units.  The user must provide the standard UAVSAR products also because the contrast ratio is defined for NRCS values in linear units.  
 - filetypes specifies all the polarizations to be analyzed (since UAVSAR products come with quad-polarization output)
 - file extention for the incidence angle file (there should be one incidence angle file per base filename)
 - A single landmask is applied, so if the user wants to run multiple basenames at once, the individual PolSAR products must be clipped to a common scene extent.

## 3. Output files
The code generates two main outputs, either as layers \(netCDF\) or separate files \(GeoTIFF, ENVI\), several JPG images visualizing the results, and one JPG showing the statistical distribution of the ocean NRCS values and the threshold chosen automatically for identifying "radar-dark" pixels. 

Presently, this code can handle ENVI, GeoTIFF, and NetCDF formats on the input side.  The output can either be the same format or ENVI format.  No protection is written for invalid output formats -- the code will just crash.
